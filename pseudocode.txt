- display the current date within the jumbotrom at the top using moment js
    - define a function that runs on page open

- there will be 8 timeblocks for business hours with a save button, text area, and hour in the same row
    - when you click the save button, the event is saved into local storage
    - the saved events persist on page refresh

- run a loop that checks each row for the assigned time, and if the timeblock is less than current time, change format/class for past, if current time, change format/class for current, if higher than current time, change format/class for future
    - if timeblock < current time then class=past
    - else if timeblock=current time then remove class pass, class=current
    - else remove other classes, add future class
        - making sure overnight it works right

------3 functions? 1 for date, 1 for checking the time, 1 for local storage?------
------------onclick event for storage--------------------------
